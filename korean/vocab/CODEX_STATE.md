# Korean Vocabulary Expansion State

## Corpus baseline

- Existing flat files under `korean/vocab/topics/` are legacy lessons and remain in place.
- New lessons use topic subfolders with local file numbering, as specified in `korean/prompt/vocabulary_goal/GOAL.md`.
- Source PDFs and dictionaries are reference material only; lesson explanations and passages are original.
- Lexical audit: 214 nested target headwords retain `advanced_native` or `contemporary_native_hot` metadata; 71 common/support words were removed from target headings but remain available in explanations and passages. The 67 legacy flat headwords are preserved as `legacy_review`.

## Resume rule

Continue with the next coherent topic rather than following source-file order. Prefer the candidate topics recorded in `korean/vocab/korean-vietnamese-wordbook.md`, and check existing headword+sense coverage before adding a word.

## Next candidates

Potential next topics include advanced public administration and regulatory language, high-register media and cultural criticism, or advanced urban and housing policy language. Choose the first topic that can form a coherent semantic network; do not force unrelated words to reach 15.
